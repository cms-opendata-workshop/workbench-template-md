# The Carpentries Workbench Template Markdown Lesson

This lesson is a template lesson that uses [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 

## Note about lesson life cycle stage
Although the `config.yaml` states the life cycle stage as pre-alpha, **the template is stable and ready to use**. The life cycle stage is preset to `"pre-alpha"` as this setting is appropriate for new lessons initialised using the template.

## Create a new repository from this template

To use this template to start a new lesson repository, 
make sure you're logged into Github.   
Visit https://github.com/cms-opendata-workshop/workbench-template-md/generate
and follow the instructions.
Checking the 'Include all branches' option will save some time waiting for the first website build
when your new repository is initialised.

## Configure a new lesson

Follow the steps below to
complete the initial configuration of a new lesson repository built from this template:

1. **Make sure GitHub Pages is activated:**
   navigate to _Settings_,
   select _Pages_ from the left sidebar,
   and make sure that `gh-pages` is selected as the branch to build from.
   If no `gh-pages` branch is available, check _Actions_ to see if the first
   website build workflows are still running.
   The branch should become available when those have completed.
1. **Adjust the `config.yaml` file:**
   this file contains global parameters for your lesson site.
   Individual fields within the file are documented with comments (beginning with `#`)
   At minimum, you should adjust all the fields marked 'FIXME':
   - `title`
   - `created`
   - `keywords`
   - `life_cycle` (the default, _pre-alpha_, is the appropriate for brand new lessons)
   - `contact`
1. **Annotate the repository** with site URL and topic tags:
   navigate back to the repository landing page and
   click on the gear wheel/cog icon (similar to ⚙️) 
   at the top-right of the _About_ box.
   Check the "Use your GitHub Pages website" option,
   and [add some keywords and other annotations to describe your lesson](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html#topic-tags)
   in the _Topics_ field.
   At minimum, these should include:
   - `lesson`
   - the life cycle of the lesson (e.g. `pre-alpha`)
   - the human language the lesson is written in (e.g. `deutsch`)
